Fresh adds shelf life to your produce and bales - crops age over time and will spoil if not sold or used!

Your harvested crops, processed products, and baled forage now have realistic shelf lives. Fresh vegetables spoil quickly, while canned products last much longer. Bales of grass spoil within days, while silage stays fresh for months. Customize shelf lives via the Fresh Menu!

Fresh Menu (Right Shift+F):
- Inventory Overview: see all perishables with oldest ages
- Loss Statistics: track what you've lost
- Settings: customize shelf lives per product

Features:
- 100+ products with realistic shelf lives
- 4 bale types with fermentation handling
- Vehicles, bales, silos, productions, husbandries supported
- Oldest items retrieved first from storage
- Daily loss notifications
- Multiplayer support (server-authoritative)
- Ages saved with your game

Notes:
- Early access - feedback welcome
- Only base game products in this version
